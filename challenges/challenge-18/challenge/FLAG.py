In the realm of online communication, cryptography is used to encrypt messages so that they can only be read by the intended recipient. This is achieved through a process of encryption, which involves transforming the original message into an unreadable format using a key. The recipient then decrypts the message using the same key, thereby ensuring the confidentiality of the information 5.

Cryptography also plays a crucial role in financial transactions. Credit card companies, for instance, use cryptographic algorithms to ensure that sensitive cardholder information is securely transmitted over the internet. This prevents unauthorized access to this information, thereby protecting cardholders from fraud 5.

Moreover, cryptography is essential in maintaining the integrity of digital content. For example, when you download a software application, it is often accompanied by a digital signature. This signature is created using the sender's private key and can be verified using the sender's public key. If the signature is valid, it confirms that the application has not been tampered with during transmission, thereby ensuring its authenticity 5.

Furthermore, cryptography is used in the field of network security to protect data in transit. Technologies such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) use cryptographic algorithms to encrypt data, thereby ensuring that it cannot be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties. This is particularly important in the context of e-commerce, where sensitive information such as credit card numbers and personal details are often transmitted over the internet 5.
