# ttf2mesh-sys

This package provides FFI bindings to [ttf2mesh C-library](https://github.com/fetisov/ttf2mesh).

This library should not be used directly. For higher-level Rust usage, see [ttf2mesh at crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ttf2mesh)

FFI bindings are provided for the supplied `ttf2mesh.c` self-contained code.

The library is built at the build time, if you don't have compiler installed:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
