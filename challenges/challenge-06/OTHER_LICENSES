- kernel/arith64.c:

// GCC 32/64-bit integer arithmetic support for 32-bit systems that can't link
// to libgcc.

// Function prototypes and descriptions are taken from
// https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Integer-library-routines.html.

// This file may be #include'd by another file, so we try not to pollute the
// namespace and we don't import any headers.

// All functions must be resolvable by the linker and therefore can't be inline
// or static, even if they're #included into the file where they'll be used.

// For best performance we try to avoid branching. This makes the code a little
// weird in places.

// See https://github.com/glitchub/arith64 for more information.
// This software is released as-is into the public domain, as described at
