    <p>
        Welcome to {brand}!
        We are a small startup that delivers Christmas Cards to your loved ones.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our delivery service is based on the latest technology.
        We use a reindeer sleigh to deliver your cards.
        This is the fastest and most reliable way to deliver your cards.

        We ran into a slight problem: Santa Claus needed the reindeer sleigh to deliver presents,
        but hasn't returned it yet. In the meantime, you can manually print your cards or send and
        receive them via our new online service!
