  The previous owner of the arcade machine still has a trace of the firmware update. Maybe there's a way to run your own firmware?

  Note 1: This challenge was updated at 2023-12-29 00:20 UTC. If you solved part 1 before this time, you will need to re-run your exploit to get the current version of the data.

  Note 2: The "reset" function will also reset the flash memory.

  Note 3: For fairness, we've re-hosted the previous version as well at challenge30.play.potluckctf.com If you have found a bug that works there but not on the newer versions, don't waste time on it, it's an unintended red herring. The intended solution works on both version. The change in offsets in the bootloader is not relevant to the exploit.
