  The previous owner of the arcade machine still has a trace of the firmware update. Maybe there's a way to run your own firmware?

  Note 1: This challenge was updated at 2023-12-28 23:45 UTC. If you solved part 1 before this time, you will need to re-run your exploit to get the current version of the data.

  Note 2: The "reset" function will also reset the flash memory.
