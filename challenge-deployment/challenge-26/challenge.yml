title: Tamagoyaki
description: "Tamagoyaki (literally 'grilled egg') is a Japanese omelette crafted by rolling layers of fried, beaten eggs.

Tamagoyaki shares similarities with glibc's malloc, as it also contains several layers of fried and beaten code.

Note: Expect 4 bits of bruteforce; Anything above that is probably a bad idea"
