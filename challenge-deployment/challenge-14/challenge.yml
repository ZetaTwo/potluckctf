title: GACHAAAAAtkr
description: "Wow it's another gacha game... but everything is so expensive! Everyone's showing off their characters, but I don't have any. Would be a shame if there was a cheat code that could give me some!

Note: The challenge was created with Python version 3.12.0a7.

Thanks to enscribe (https://enscribe.dev) for the assets used in the game!"
