title: CanGoSpace 1
description: "Welcome to SpaceForce! One of our critical communication satellites went silent, is unresponsive to remote control and its orbit is unstable. The only solution: you must venture into space and hack your way directly into its systems to avert an impending disaster.
We even have a copy of the satellites internal systems ready for you, so you can test everything before your departure!

Flag 1: Can you access the system and extract the error information?
Flag 2: Great, you got system access! Now all thatâ€™s left to do, hack the system and return the satellite to a safe orbit!"
