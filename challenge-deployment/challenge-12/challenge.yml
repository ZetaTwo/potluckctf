title: Shell No Evil
description: '> Due to the special background of the R&D unit of Sunway CPU, the SW64 instruction set has not been made public so far. Although non-disclosure of the instruction set is very detrimental to the construction of the software ecosystem, it also prevents malicious attackers from writing shellcode targeting Sunway processors, and the product has extremely high self-security.

Surely writing shellcode for an ""unknown"" architecture is impossible, right, right???

Note: Flag located at /flag_<a random uuid>, there is no /bin/sh.
